                        Hello, World! I am Zandro Francis J. Delgado, a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
                        student at Cebu Technological University (Main Campus).
                        I was born on September 22, 2005. I've always been drawn to gaming, whether it's FPS (First
                        Person Shooting), which means I enjoy shooter games like Valorant, Counter Strike 2, Crossfire,
                        Apex Legends, and so on.
                        My other pleasure is singing, which I find peaceful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At 19 years old, I am motivated by a great love of technology and its potential to improve our
                        world.
                        Growing up in Bacayan, Cebu City, I was always intrigued about how things worked, so I decided
                        to pursue a profession in information technology.

                        I attended Talamban Elementary School from 2011 to 2017, where I established the groundwork for

                        with a variety of areas, including mathematics, science, and languages.

                        From 2020 to 2023, I attended senior high school at the University of Cebu (Banilad Campus),

                        This year was essential in shaping my academic interests, preparing me for my current work in
                        computer technology.
                        I researched certain topics linked to my professional goals and participated in a number of

                        I am currently in my second year of study at Cebu Technological University, pursuing a Bachelor

                        This course wonderfully connects with my interest in technology and how it can affect the world
                        around us.
                        Throughout my studies, I've been exposed to a variety of disciplines, including programming,
                        data structure, and web development, which have helped me have a better grasp of the technology
